# Quick GitHub Setup for BestBuddyAI

## Fresh Start Approach

1. **Delete your current GitHub repository** if you want to start clean
2. **Create a new repository** on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it: `BestBuddyAI`
   - Make it public
   - Don't initialize with README (we have one)

3. **Try Replit's Git integration again**:
   - Go to your Replit "Tools" → "Git" 
   - Or look for Version Control in the sidebar
   - Connect to your NEW empty repository

4. **If that still fails, use this simple method**:
   - Download your project as ZIP from Replit
   - Extract on your computer
   - Upload to GitHub using GitHub Desktop or command line
